Visit the deployed link <a href='https://limitless-shelf-08303.herokuapp.com/notes'>here </a>

Once on the page, click the + symbol to start a new note. All previous notes can be seen on the sidebar on the left hand side. Type out whatever you would like to save as a note and once you're finished click the floppy disc icon to save it to the sidebar on the left. If you find that you'd rather delete a note you can click the trashcan icon while the unwanted note is selected.
